## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Musings
This was a first time working with Mongo DB and Mongoose. This project was rather straight forward and was furthering understanding of two new technologies. 
The projects for UCF have been less tedious trying to learn syntax, but more skull sweat in learning new technologies.
