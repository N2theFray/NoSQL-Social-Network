Insomnia
NoSQL
Mongo DB
Mongoose

## User Story
A social networking app where a user is able to post, edit, and delete thoughts, users and reactions

## My Story
This was a first time working with Mongo DB and Mongoose. This project was rather straight forward and was furthering understanding of two new technologies. 
The projects for UCF have been less tedious trying to learn syntax, but more skull sweat in learning new technologies.
